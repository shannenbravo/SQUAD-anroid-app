# SQUAD-anroid-app
With the goal of finding your friend group with ease, we created an application to log your location to let your friends know where you are. Showing your squad will display google maps with markers displaying the name and location of where your friends are. Adding your friends is just as easy as it is just a lookup through their registered email. With ease of use in mind, we wanted to allow anyone and everyone to grow and find their squad.

## Bugs

Pressing the back button after the empty page of showing squad will display that list.
* When displaying the list of squad, it will show everyone that is registered.
* When displaying squad on the map, it will display all the registered users.
* Adding friends will populate a friends list for each respective user, mapping each friends list to the show squad list will show everyone outside of that list.
* The viewSquad and growMySquad has not been connected to the dasboard buttons
* The checkin button does get your cuurent loacation but it  it fials to noftify the user
